# 🍉🗡️ WatermelonKatana: State of Development - 11/17/24

## 🌟 Preface

Hey everyone! 👋 Colack here with your latest WatermelonKatana (WK) update! This newsletter will hopefully become a regular feature, either bi-weekly or monthly, where we’ll share all the exciting things we’re working on and upcoming features. So, let's dive in and see what's fresh! 🍉✨

### 🚨 Fix Announcements

We’ve made some exciting improvements to our announcement system! 🎉 It’s now more robust and features a Markdown-based rendering context, replacing the basic HTML page. Thanks to our awesome friends at [GitHub](https://github.com/), we’ve implemented this using actions and workflows! 🚀 This should make updates more dynamic and easier to follow.

### 🛠️ TurboWarp Updates

Improved Overrides are live! 🔧 Ever wondered why some variables can be overridden on CDO but not on TurboWarp? Well, we’ve found that specific registry variables, when declared in the global scope using just var, prevent listeners from updating them. This bug, caused by the CDO interpreter, has now been fixed!

P.S. The matching isn’t 100% perfect yet, as regex has its quirks when it comes to language parsing. But as long as your code is clean and concise, you shouldn’t run into issues. 🧑‍💻

### 🐞 BugTesting

We’ve got some major updates coming to WatermelonKatana in the next couple of weeks, and we could really use your help to bug test! 🔍 If you spot any pesky bugs, don’t hesitate to report them in our bug-reporting channel on Discord or on the Issues/Discussions tabs. As a special thank you, anyone who reports a bug before our next big release will receive a BetaBugTester badge! 🎖️

## 💬 Closing Statement

That’s all for this update! We can’t wait to hear your thoughts, bug reports, and suggestions as we continue to improve WatermelonKatana. Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of the WK community! 😄

Until next time, stay awesome! ✨
