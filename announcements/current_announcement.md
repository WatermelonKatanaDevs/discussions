# 🌟 WatermelonKatana Update – March 13, 2025

## 🌟 Preface

Hello Everyone! Varrience here, I will be giving the announcement in Colacks place.
Unfortunately development is coming to a slowdown as of late. Now that mostly all the bugs are squashed. We encourage you to expore our site since everything should be stable.

## 🚨 Updates and Announcements

### 🤔 Content and Updates Going Forward
Since Colacks disengagement of the project *(mainly personal life issues and will be taking a indefinite hiatus until further notice)* and Dragon being busy most of the time. I have been maintaining the project for about a few months now. Ensuring that stuff gets patched and QOL updates happen; so there's less user fustration. For now at least I will also be cutting back on new features and contributions to WatermelonKatana. I am currently pursuing another project that I currently have more direction and motivation to build. That being said fixes and critical bugs will be fixed! Just less features are being focused on right now.
