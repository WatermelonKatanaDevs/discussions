# WatermelonKatana Update: November 21st, 2025

## Intro
Greetings fellow WK users I hope you have been enjoying our services and community content so far! It's been a while since our last update. As of late development has slowed down while focus has been improving the site for better user experience.

## Updates and Announcements

### Changelog
- Fix turbowarp critical bug that would allow of out of bounds script termination
- Image uploads to our site were temporarily having issues between *09/26/25 - 10/01/25* due to our third party host having issues with our API key (we apologize if you were effected durring the outage)
- Improve overrides for gamelab actively listening for key varriables instead of checking before runtime
- Recently viewed posts are availible on the dashboard

## What We're Working On

Since development is still slowly moving along it's best to keep our expectations low for now and be upfront with our users. Updates and fixes may take some time, currently there are 3 things that are of some priority but not essential to the project uptime
- Migrating the old pfps from profiles to the new path we use
- Updating ease of access for admins to edit the database
- Updating old view counts to the new way we count views

Again there are no expected times when these become implemented so if you want a feature implemented feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/orgs/WatermelonKatanaDevs/repositories) to our site
